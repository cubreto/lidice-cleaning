# Phase 2: SBIR/STTR Grant Strategy – Novel PDEV-CsA Platform

## Executive Summary: What Makes This Novel?

**The Problem**: Existing CsA nanocarriers are synthetic, expensive, and don't leverage natural gut-targeting mechanisms.

**Our Innovation**: A **three-component synergistic platform** that goes beyond simple encapsulation:

1. **Rational Plant Source Selection** – Not just "any plant EV" but optimized citrus species based on natural cargo
2. **Dual-Drug Loading** – CsA + a second complementary immunomodulator with different MOA
3. **Endogenous Bioenhancement** – Preserve native citrus flavonoids/antioxidants that reduce CsA nephrotoxicity

**Patentable Hooks**:
- Specific EV:drug:flavonoid ratios with synergistic efficacy
- Novel loading method preserving both drug AND endogenous cargo
- Gut-targeted delivery with <30% systemic CsA exposure vs. current formulations

---

## Section 1: Novel Composition of Matter

### 1.1 Rational Selection of Citrus Species

**Innovation**: Not all citrus EVs are equal. We will screen 3-4 citrus sources based on:

| Citrus Source | Key Endogenous Cargo | Hypothesis |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Sweet Orange** (*C. sinensis*) | Hesperidin, naringenin | Anti-inflammatory, barrier protection |
| **Grapefruit** (*C. paradisi*) | Naringin, bergamottin (CYP3A4 inhibitor) | Boost CsA bioavailability locally |
| **Lemon** (*C. limon*) | Eriocitrin, high vitamin C | Antioxidant protection, reduce nephrotoxicity |
| **Bergamot** (*C. bergamia*) | Brutieridin, melitidin | Lipid metabolism modulation |

**Experiment (Aim 1a)**:
- Isolate EVs from each source
- Quantify endogenous flavonoid content by HPLC
- Test CsA loading efficiency (hypothesis: bergamottin in grapefruit EVs improves CsA retention)
- **Go/No-Go**: Select lead source with ≥60% CsA EE% AND measurable flavonoid retention

**Novelty Claim**: "Citrus EVs selected based on endogenous CYP3A4-modulating or antioxidant cargo to synergize with CsA pharmacology"

---

### 1.2 Dual-Drug Loading: CsA + Low-Dose Corticosteroid

**Innovation**: IBD treatment often combines calcineurin inhibitors + steroids. Instead of systemic co-administration, we co-load PDEVs.

**Rationale**:
- CsA: Calcineurin/NFAT pathway (T-cell suppression)
- Budesonide or Dexamethasone: NF-κB pathway (epithelial/macrophage)
- **Synergy**: Target both adaptive and innate immunity locally
- **Safety**: Lower doses of each drug when combined in PDEVs

**Experiment (Aim 1b)**:
- Load PDEVs with CsA alone, Dex alone, or CsA+Dex (varying ratios)
- Test in vitro:
  - T-cell IL-2 suppression (CsA effect)
  - Macrophage TNF-α suppression (Dex effect)
  - Intestinal epithelial barrier function (transepithelial resistance)
- Hypothesis: 1:0.1 CsA:Dex ratio achieves additive/synergistic suppression at 50% lower doses

**Go/No-Go**: Dual-loaded PDEVs show ≥1.5× potency vs. single-drug formulations in at least 2 assays

**Novelty Claim**: "Co-encapsulation of complementary immunosuppressants with distinct mechanisms in plant EVs for multi-pathway IBD targeting"

---

### 1.3 Flavonoid Preservation and Synergy

**Innovation**: Most loading protocols destroy native EV cargo. We preserve it intentionally.

**Hypothesis**: Citrus flavonoids (hesperidin, naringenin) act as:
1. **Antioxidants** – Reduce CsA-induced ROS and nephrotoxicity
2. **Tight junction modulators** – Improve epithelial barrier function
3. **Immune modulators** – Direct anti-inflammatory effects

**Experiment (Aim 1c)**:
- Compare two loading protocols:
  - Protocol A: High-organic solvent method (high CsA loading, destroys flavonoids)
  - Protocol B: Our novel aqueous-phase transfer method (preserves flavonoids)
- Measure:
  - CsA encapsulation efficiency
  - Flavonoid retention (HPLC)
  - Renal cell toxicity assay (human proximal tubule cells + PDEV-CsA)

**Go/No-Go**: Protocol B retains ≥40% flavonoids with ≥50% CsA EE%, and reduces renal cytotoxicity by ≥30% vs. Protocol A

**Novelty Claim**: "PDEV loading method that preserves native bioactive cargo to reduce drug toxicity"

---

## Section 2: Novel Loading Method – "Gentle Fusion Protocol"

### 2.1 Current Problem

Standard EV drug loading:
- **Passive diffusion**: Poor for very hydrophobic drugs
- **Electroporation**: Disrupts EV integrity, expensive
- **Sonication**: May aggregate EVs and denature surface proteins
- **Organic solvents**: Destroy native cargo and surface markers

### 2.2 Our Innovation: "Gentle Fusion Protocol"

**Concept**: Exploit the natural membrane fluidity of plant EVs using temperature cycling + biocompatible cosolvents.

**Protocol Steps**:

```
1. Pre-activation: Incubate EVs at 37°C for 15 min (increase membrane fluidity)

2. Drug introduction:
   - Dissolve CsA in minimal ethanol (<5% v/v final)
   - Add dropwise to pre-warmed EVs under gentle stirring
   - Maintain 37°C for 30 min

3. Membrane annealing:
   - Rapid cool to 4°C (5 min) → "freeze" CsA into membrane
   - Optional: brief (30 sec) low-power sonication pulse

4. Purification:
   - Size-exclusion chromatography (remove free CsA)
   - Concentrate by tangential flow filtration

5. Stability enhancement:
   - Add 5% trehalose (lyoprotectant)
   - Optional: lyophilize for long-term storage
```

**Why This Is Novel**:
- Temperature cycling exploits phase transition of plant lipid bilayers (different from mammalian EVs)
- Minimal solvent preserves surface proteins (CD63, tetraspanins) AND native cargo
- Scalable (no electroporation equipment needed)

**Experiment (Aim 2a)**:
- Compare Gentle Fusion to 3 standard methods
- Metrics:
  - CsA EE% and loading capacity (μg CsA/mg EV protein)
  - EV integrity: TEM morphology, surface marker retention (Western blot for CD63)
  - Flavonoid retention
  - Stability: 1, 4, 12 weeks at 4°C and -80°C

**Go/No-Go**: Gentle Fusion achieves ≥60% EE%, retains ≥80% of surface markers, and maintains ≥90% CsA content at 4°C for 4 weeks

## Section 3: SBIR Phase I Specific Aims (Full Draft)

**Project Title**: "Synergistic Plant Extracellular Vesicle Platform for Oral Cyclosporine A Delivery in Severe Ulcerative Colitis"

**PI**: [Bea's full name and credentials]

**Applicant Organization**: [Company name] (Small Business) in partnership with [Academic Institution]

---

### Overall Project Goal

To develop a first-in-class oral nanocarrier platform using rationally selected plant extracellular vesicles that co-deliver cyclosporine A with synergistic bioactive cargo for gut-targeted immunosuppression in acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), with reduced systemic toxicity.

### Specific Aims

#### **Aim 1: Engineer optimized PDEV-CsA formulations through rational source selection and dual-drug loading**

**Rationale**: Current CsA formulations lack gut targeting and cause dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Plant EVs offer natural advantages: GI stability, low immunogenicity, and endogenous bioactive cargo. However, not all plant sources are equivalent, and single-drug approaches miss opportunities for synergy.

**Approach**:
- **Sub-aim 1a**: Screen 4 citrus species (orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot) for EV yield, endogenous flavonoid content, and CsA loading efficiency.
- **Sub-aim 1b**: Develop dual-loaded PDEV formulations (CsA + low-dose budesonide) and optimize drug ratios for synergistic immunosuppression.
- **Sub-aim 1c**: Validate that our novel "Gentle Fusion" loading protocol preserves both drug potency and endogenous flavonoid cargo.

**Outcomes**:
- Lead PDEV formulation with ≥60% CsA encapsulation efficiency
- Defined drug:flavonoid ratio with demonstrated synergy
- Stable formulation (≥90% drug retention at 4°C for 4 weeks)

**Deliverable**: Reproducible SOP for lead PDEV-CsA manufacturing (3 validation batches)

---

#### **Aim 2: Demonstrate superior cellular uptake, immunosuppression, and barrier protection in human intestinal/immune cell models**

**Rationale**: For ASUC, an ideal therapy must: (1) suppress T-cell activation, (2) reduce epithelial inflammation, and (3) restore intestinal barrier function. We hypothesize PDEV-CsA achieves all three via targeted delivery and synergistic cargo.

**Approach**:
- **Sub-aim 2a (Uptake)**:
  - Compare fluorescently labeled PDEV-CsA vs. free CsA uptake in Caco-2 cells and primary human intestinal organoids
  - Use endocytosis inhibitors to map uptake pathways
  - Quantify intracellular CsA concentration by LC-MS/MS

- **Sub-aim 2b (T-cell suppression)**:
  - Human PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28
  - Measure IL-2, IFN-γ secretion (ELISA)
  - Calculate IC50 for PDEV-CsA vs. free CsA
  - Test dual-loaded (CsA+Dex) for synergy

- **Sub-aim 2c (Epithelial barrier)**:
  - Transwell assay: measure transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
  - TNF-α-challenged Caco-2 monolayers treated with PDEV-CsA
  - Assess tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin) by Western blot and immunofluorescence

**Outcomes**:
- ≥2-fold increase in cellular uptake vs. free CsA
- ≥50% reduction in IL-2/IFN-γ with dual-loaded formulation at half-dose
- ≥30% improvement in TEER recovery vs. free CsA

**Deliverable**: Complete in vitro efficacy profile with dose-response curves

---

#### **Aim 3: Establish in vivo proof-of-concept in a murine model of acute colitis with reduced systemic toxicity**

**Rationale**: ASUC patients face colectomy if rescue therapy fails. Current CsA use is limited by nephrotoxicity and therapeutic drug monitoring burden. We hypothesize PDEV-CsA achieves equivalent efficacy with <30% systemic exposure.

**Approach**:
- **Model**: DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice (7 days DSS, treat on days 3-7)
- **Groups** (n=10 each):
  1. Vehicle control
  2. Empty PDEVs (control for EV effects)
  3. Free CsA (positive control, 10 mg/kg oral)
  4. PDEV-CsA (equivalent to 10 mg/kg CsA)
  5. PDEV-CsA+Dex (dual-loaded, reduced dose: 5 mg/kg CsA-equivalent)

- **Efficacy endpoints**:
  - Daily: body weight, stool consistency, fecal blood
  - Day 8: disease activity index (DAI), colon length
  - Histology: inflammation score (blinded pathologist)
  - Tissue cytokines: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 (colon homogenates)
  - Immune profiling: flow cytometry of colonic lamina propria (CD4+ T cells, macrophages)

- **Safety/PK endpoints**:
  - **Systemic exposure**: Plasma CsA concentration at 2h and 6h (LC-MS/MS)
  - **Nephrotoxicity**: Serum creatinine, BUN, kidney histology
  - **Hepatotoxicity**: ALT, AST
  - **Biodistribution**: Radiolabeled PDEV-CsA tissue distribution (colon vs. kidney)

**Go/No-Go Criteria**:
1. **Efficacy**: PDEV-CsA achieves ≥30% DAI reduction vs. vehicle, non-inferior to free CsA
2. **Safety**: Plasma CsA AUC for PDEV-CsA is ≤70% of free CsA
3. **Target engagement**: ≥2-fold higher CsA concentration in colon tissue vs. free CsA

**Deliverable**: Complete efficacy and safety package ready for Phase II IND-enabling studies

## Section 4: Innovation and Significance (Grant Text)

### Innovation

This project introduces **three major innovations** that advance beyond current EV-based drug delivery and CsA formulations:

**1. Rational Engineering of Plant EV Platforms**

While prior work has shown that plant EVs *can* carry drugs, this is the first systematic approach to **match plant source to therapeutic need**. By selecting citrus species based on endogenous flavonoid profiles (e.g., grapefruit bergamottin for local CYP3A4 inhibition), we create formulations where the carrier itself contributes to efficacy and safety—a paradigm shift from inert synthetic nanoparticles.

**2. Synergistic Multi-Drug Co-Encapsulation**

Current IBD treatment guidelines recommend combining immunosuppressants (CsA) with corticosteroids, but systemic co-administration amplifies toxicity. Our dual-loaded PDEV platform enables **site-specific combination therapy** with lower doses of each agent, targeting complementary pathways (calcineurin + NF-κB) in the inflamed gut while sparing systemic tissues.

**3. "Gentle Fusion" Loading Protocol**

Existing EV loading methods prioritize drug encapsulation efficiency at the expense of EV functionality. Our temperature-cycling approach preserves both surface proteins (for gut targeting) and native cargo (for synergy), creating a **bioactive formulation** rather than a passive container. This method is also scalable and requires no specialized equipment, lowering barriers to commercial translation.

### Significance

**Unmet Clinical Need**:
- Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) affects ~25% of UC patients and carries 25-30% risk of colectomy within the first year.
- CsA is effective (60-80% response rate) but causes nephrotoxicity in 20-40% of patients, limiting use.
- Current oral CsA formulations (Neoral, Gengraf) have poor gut targeting and wide pharmacokinetic variability.

**Market Opportunity**:
- 3 million IBD patients in US/EU, ~75,000 ASUC cases/year
- CsA market for transplant + autoimmune: $2B+ globally
- Oral, gut-targeted formulation could expand use to maintenance therapy (currently avoided due to toxicity)

**Translational Path**:
- Phase I delivers formulation + proof-of-concept efficacy/safety
- Phase II (Year 2-3): GLP toxicology, IND-enabling CMC, large animal PK
- Phase IIa trial in ASUC patients (Year 4-5) partnering with academic medical centers

**Scientific Impact**:
- Establishes plant EVs as a modular platform for hydrophobic drug delivery (extensible to other drugs: tacrolimus, sirolimus, cannabinoids)
- Demonstrates that native EV cargo can be leveraged for synergy (a new dimension in rational nanocarrier design)
- Generates preclinical safety data supporting regulatory path for edible plant-derived biologics

**Subject**: Phase 2 SBIR Strategy – Novel PDEV-CsA Platform

Hi Bea,

I've put together a detailed strategy for the SBIR Phase I grant focusing on our PDEV-CsA platform. The key innovations we're emphasizing:

1. **Rational citrus selection** based on endogenous flavonoid profiles (not just "any plant EV")
2. **Dual-drug loading** (CsA + low-dose steroid) for synergistic gut immunosuppression
3. **Gentle Fusion protocol** that preserves both drug AND native bioactive cargo

I've drafted the Specific Aims and experimental plans with clear go/no-go milestones. The grant targets $500K over 12 months to deliver:
- Optimized formulation (3 validation batches)
- Complete in vitro efficacy profile
- Mouse colitis POC with PK/safety data

**What we need for preliminary data** (to be competitive):
1. Orange EV characterization (size, morphology, flavonoids) – 2 weeks
2. CsA loading and stability – 3 weeks
3. *Ideally* one in vitro efficacy signal (T-cell assay) – 4 weeks

Can we schedule a call this week to:
- Decide on plant source (I suggest starting with sweet orange, add grapefruit if time allows)
- Assign writing sections (I can handle Approach/Budget, you lead on Significance/Innovation)
- Map out lab timeline for preliminary experiments

I've created a shared document with all the draft text—we can iterate directly in there.

Let me know your availability!

Best,
[Your name]

## Section 9: Additional Novel Angles to Consider

If you want to strengthen novelty even further:

### Option A: "Smart Release" Triggered by Inflammation

**Concept**: PDEVs are naturally pH-sensitive. Inflamed gut (UC) has lower pH microenvironment.

**Experiment**: Show that PDEV-CsA releases more drug at pH 5.5 (inflamed) vs. pH 7.4 (healthy).

**Claim**: "Inflammation-responsive drug release from plant EVs"

---

### Option B: Microbiome Interaction

**Concept**: Gut bacteria can modify plant EVs and their cargo.

**Experiment**: Incubate PDEV-CsA with fecal microbiota from healthy vs. UC patients. Measure:
- EV integrity (size, morphology)
- CsA release kinetics
- Bacterial metabolites produced

**Claim**: "Microbiome-mediated bioactivation of PDEV cargo"

---

### Option C: Surface Engineering

**Concept**: Conjugate targeting ligands to EV surface (e.g., anti-integrin α4β7 antibody fragments for IBD targeting).

**Experiment**: Conjugate antibody to EV surface using EDC/NHS chemistry. Show increased uptake in α4β7+ T cells.

**Claim**: "Immunotargeted plant EVs for precision IBD therapy"

---

## Final Thoughts

**Why this approach will win funding:**

1. ✅ **Clear unmet need** (ASUC patients face colectomy)
2. ✅ **Strong scientific premise** (plant EVs are validated; CsA works but is toxic)
3. ✅ **Multiple layers of innovation** (source selection + dual-loading + gentle fusion)
4. ✅ **Commercial path** (SBIR reviewers love products, not just papers)
5. ✅ **Feasible in Phase I timeline** (no heroic assumptions)
6. ✅ **De-risked by preliminary data** (you'll have 2-3 strong figures)

**Your competitive advantage:**
- Most plant EV groups are still doing basic biodistribution studies
- Most CsA nanoformulation groups use synthetic materials
- **You're at the intersection**: plant EVs + clinical-stage drug + defined indication

Let me know which experiments you want to prioritize and I can help with:
- Detailed protocols
- Power calculations for animal studies
- Budget spreadsheet
- Grant text refinement
