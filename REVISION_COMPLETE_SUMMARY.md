## ✅ ALL USER-REQUESTED REFINEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Definition of "Therapeutic Phospholipids" (Section 2.2)
✅ Added explicit definition:
> **Therapeutic glycerophospholipids** are **non-conjugated, "true" glycerophospholipids** – molecules with a glycerol backbone, a phosphate-containing polar headgroup, and two fatty-acyl chains, which are **not covalently linked to non-lipid drugs** (i.e., not phospholipid prodrugs).

✅ Platform constraint stated explicitly:
> This platform uses **exclusively true glycerophospholipids** (no polymeric cores, no phospholipid-drug prodrugs)

### 2. Revised Composition of Matter Claim (Section 5.1)
✅ Independent Claim 1 now specifies:
- "non-conjugated, non-prodrug phospholipids"
- Quantitative ranges: 15-60 mol% of total vesicle membrane phospholipids
- ≥1.5-fold enrichment relative to unmodified plant EVs

### 3. Concrete Therapeutic Compositions (Section 3.1.1)
✅ Added two flagship therapeutic mixes with mol% ranges:

**Barrier-Repair Mix (BRM):**
- 30-40 mol% PC with linoleic acid (18:2)
- 15-20 mol% omega-3 PS (DHA/EPA)
- 10-15 mol% PE with 18:1, 18:2
- Target: LPC/PC ratio <0.15, PC/PE ratio 2.0-2.5

**Resolution-Promoting Mix (RPM):**
- 25-35 mol% DHA-PC
- 15-20 mol% EPA-PE
- Reduced arachidonic acid (<10 mol%)
- Target: Omega-3 index >15%, AA/EPA ratio <3

### 4. Enhanced Differentiation from LT-02 (Section 2.4)
✅ Added explicit comparison paragraph:
> **LT-02 (Delayed-Release Phosphatidylcholine):**
> - Mechanism: Topical luminal supplementation
> - Delivery: PC released in colon, enriches mucus surface layer
> - Limitation: Limited cellular uptake
>
> **Our PDEV-Therapeutic Phospholipid Platform:**
> - Mechanism: Direct cellular membrane integration
> - Delivery: EVs fuse/endocytose into epithelial and immune cells
> - Result: Multi-lipid compositions restore comprehensive membrane properties

### 5. Platform Constraint in SBIR Aims (Section 6.1.1)
✅ Added explicit constraint statement:
> **Platform constraint:** All formulations will be built **exclusively from true glycerophospholipids and plant EV lipids**; no polymeric nanoparticle cores or phospholipid-drug prodrugs will be used in this platform.

### 6. Lipidomic QC Metrics (Section 6.1.1 Milestones)
✅ Added quantitative success criteria:
- **BRM:** PC/PE ratio 2.0-2.5 ± 0.3, LPC/PC <0.20
- **RPM:** Omega-3 index >15%, AA/EPA ratio <3.5
- **Enrichment:** ≥1.5-fold vs. unmodified EVs (across ≥3 independent batches)

### 7. Inflammatory Challenge Model (Section 6.1.2)
✅ Added to in vitro permeability assays:
- TNF-α (10 ng/mL) + IFN-γ (20 ng/mL) stimulation of monolayers
- LPS-challenged ex vivo colon explants
- Target: Maintain TEER >60% vs. pre-challenge baseline

### 8. Quantitative IBD Membrane Pathology (Section 2.3)
✅ Added specific pathology markers:
- **Increased LPC/PC ratio:** >0.30 in UC (vs. <0.15 healthy)
- **Decreased omega-3 index:** <8% (vs. >12% healthy)
- **Increased arachidonic acid:** >25 mol% driving pro-inflammatory eicosanoids
- **Reduced linoleic/α-linolenic:** Decreased 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids
