## 🔬 PLATFORM 1: MEMBRANE THERAPEUTICS

### One-Line Description
Plant extracellular vesicles with integrated therapeutic glycerophospholipid compositions that directly repair and normalize intestinal epithelial membrane properties in IBD.

### Core Innovation
- **NOT drug delivery** – the phospholipids ARE the therapy
- Therapeutic phospholipids integrated into PDEV membranes (15-60 mol%, ≥1.5-fold enrichment)
- Multi-lipid compositions target specific IBD membrane pathologies
- Cellular membrane integration (not just luminal supplementation)

### Two Flagship Compositions

**Barrier-Repair Mix (BRM):**
- 30-40 mol% PC with linoleic acid (18:2)
- 15-20 mol% omega-3 PS (DHA/EPA)
- 10-15 mol% PE with 18:1, 18:2
- Target: LPC/PC <0.15, PC/PE ratio 2.0-2.5

**Resolution-Promoting Mix (RPM):**
- 25-35 mol% DHA-PC (resolvins precursor)
- 15-20 mol% EPA-PE (SPM precursor)
- Reduced arachidonic acid (<10 mol%)
- Target: Omega-3 index >15%, AA/EPA ratio <3

### Target IBD Membrane Pathology
- **Increased LPC/PC ratio:** >0.30 in UC (vs. <0.15 healthy)
- **Decreased omega-3 index:** <8% (vs. >12% healthy)
- **Increased arachidonic acid:** >25 mol% driving inflammation
- **Reduced linoleic/α-linolenic:** Decreased 18:2 and 18:3

### Key Differentiation
- **vs. LT-02 (PC products):** Cellular integration vs. mucus-level supplementation
- **vs. CsA-prodrugs:** Membrane repair vs. drug delivery
- **vs. PLGA systems:** Exclusively true phospholipids, no polymers
- **vs. standard plant EVs:** Engineered lipid enrichment (≥1.5-fold)

### Clinical Application
- **Target:** Mild-moderate IBD (first-line therapy)
- **Mechanism:** Restore membrane barrier function and lipid homeostasis
- **Advantage:** No systemic drug exposure, GRAS status potential
- **Market:** \$500M+ IBD segment, \$8B+ lipid therapeutics

## 🔬 PLATFORM 2: TRIPLE-GATED CsA DELIVERY

### One-Line Description
Multi-compartment oral delivery platform: CsA encapsulated in phospholipid nanoparticles loaded into plant-derived EVs and tethered via PLA₂-cleavable phospholipid linkers for triple-gated control.

### Core Innovation
- **Drug delivery system** – phospholipids are the CARRIER for CsA
- Three phospholipid-based control layers (PDEV protection, PLA₂ trigger, phospholipid matrix release)
- CsA physically encapsulated (NOT covalently conjugated)
- PLA₂-cleavable linkers as tethers (NOT prodrugs)

### Triple-Gated Mechanism

**Gate 1 – PDEV Protection and Targeting:**
- PDEVs shield phospholipid NPs from gastric acid/enzymes (>80% survival)
- Natural gut tropism: 2-3-fold accumulation in inflamed tissue
- GRAS status potential

**Gate 2 – PLA₂-Triggered Release:**
- PLA₂-cleavable phospholipid linkers tether NPs to PDEV membrane
- Inflamed colon: 10-50-fold elevated sPLA₂ cleaves linkers
- Spatial selectivity: preferential NP release at disease sites

**Gate 3 – Phospholipid Matrix-Controlled Release:**
- High-Tm phospholipids (DPPC/DSPC) provide sustained CsA release
- Lipid phase behavior controls kinetics (not polymer erosion)
- Duration: 24-72h local immunosuppression

### Phospholipid Nanoparticle Compositions

**Component 1: High-Tm Phospholipids**
- DPPC/DSPC (30-50 mol%) for slow CsA desorption
- Cholesterol (20-40 mol%) for structural stability

**Component 2: Therapeutic Phospholipids**
- Same BRM and RPM compositions as Platform 1
- Provides dual benefit: carrier function + membrane repair
- Differentiates from simple liposomes

**CsA Loading:**
- 5-10 wt% of total lipid
- Size: 80-150 nm
- Encapsulation efficiency: >80%

### Expected Therapeutic Outcomes

**Multi-Level Advantage:**
- PDEV targeting: 2-3-fold colonic enrichment
- PLA₂ trigger: 3-5-fold preferential release in inflamed tissue
- Phospholipid matrix: 3-6-fold longer residence time
- **Combined:** 10-30-fold improvement in therapeutic index

**Clinical Endpoints:**
- Efficacy: Equivalent response (70-80%) at 50% dose (5 vs. 10 mg/kg)
- Safety: 50-70% reduction in systemic exposure (AUC)
- Nephrotoxicity: <10% vs. 20-30% for standard oral CsA

### Key Differentiation
- **vs. CsA-phospholipid prodrugs (Marković):** Linkers as tethers, not prodrugs; CsA physically encapsulated
- **vs. PLGA NPs:** All-phospholipid architecture, no polymer incompatibility
- **vs. Liposomal CsA:** Triple-gated control vs. simple encapsulation
- **vs. Plant EVs alone:** Integration of inner NPs + PLA₂ trigger

### Clinical Application
- **Target:** Acute severe UC (rescue therapy for steroid-refractory patients)
- **Mechanism:** High local mucosal immunosuppression, minimal systemic exposure
- **Advantage:** Reduced nephrotoxicity risk, oral administration
- **Market:** \$500M+ acute severe UC segment
