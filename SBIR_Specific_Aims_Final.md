Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) affects ~75,000 patients annually in the US and carries a 25-30% risk of colectomy. Cyclosporine A (CsA), a potent calcineurin inhibitor, achieves 60-80% response rates but causes dose-limiting nephrotoxicity in 20-40% of patients, restricting its use. Current oral CsA formulations lack gut specificity, resulting in high systemic exposure and therapeutic drug monitoring burden. There is an urgent need for **gut-targeted CsA delivery that preserves efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity**.

Plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) are emerging as a revolutionary class of oral nanocarriers: they are naturally biocompatible, stable in the GI tract, and capable of delivering hydrophobic drugs while carrying endogenous bioactive cargo. Citrus EVs, abundant in juice waste streams, contain flavonoids (hesperidin, naringenin) with demonstrated intestinal anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective properties. However, **no prior work has systematically engineered PDEVs for synergistic drug delivery** by matching plant source to therapeutic need, co-loading complementary drugs, or preserving native cargo.

**Our central hypothesis** is that rationally designed PDEV-CsA formulations will achieve superior gut-targeted immunosuppression with <70% systemic CsA exposure compared to conventional formulations, reducing nephrotoxicity risk while maintaining efficacy in ASUC.

## SPECIFIC AIMS

### **AIM 1: Engineer optimized PDEV-CsA formulations through rational source selection and synergistic co-loading**

We will screen 4 citrus species (orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot) based on endogenous flavonoid profiles and develop a novel "Gentle Fusion" loading protocol that preserves both drug potency and native bioactive cargo. We will create dual-loaded formulations (CsA + low-dose budesonide) targeting complementary immunosuppressive pathways.

**Expected Outcome**: Lead PDEV formulation with ≥60% CsA encapsulation efficiency, defined drug:flavonoid ratio, and 4-week stability at 4°C (≥90% drug retention).

---

### **AIM 2: Demonstrate superior cellular uptake, immunosuppression, and barrier protection in human intestinal and immune cell models**

We will quantify PDEV-CsA uptake in Caco-2 cells and primary intestinal organoids using fluorescence microscopy and LC-MS/MS. We will assess T-cell suppression (IL-2, IFN-γ), macrophage modulation (TNF-α), and epithelial barrier function (transepithelial resistance, tight junction proteins) in TNF-α-challenged monolayers.

**Expected Outcome**: ≥2-fold increase in cellular CsA delivery vs. free drug; ≥50% reduction in inflammatory cytokines with dual-loaded formulation at half-dose; ≥30% improvement in barrier integrity.

---

### **AIM 3: Establish in vivo proof-of-concept efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity in DSS-induced colitis**

We will compare oral PDEV-CsA (single and dual-loaded) vs. free CsA in C57BL/6 mice with DSS colitis (n=10/group). Primary endpoints: disease activity index, colon histology, and plasma CsA pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints: biodistribution (colon vs. kidney), serum creatinine, and tissue cytokines.

**Expected Outcome**: PDEV-CsA achieves ≥30% disease score reduction (non-inferior to free CsA) with ≤70% systemic exposure and ≥2-fold higher colonic CsA concentration.

## IMPACT AND INNOVATION

**Innovation**: This is the **first systematic engineering approach** to match plant EV source to therapeutic need, combining (1) rational citrus selection based on CYP3A4-modulating or antioxidant cargo, (2) synergistic dual-drug co-encapsulation, and (3) a scalable loading method that preserves EV functionality. Our platform transforms PDEVs from passive containers into bioactive formulations.

**Significance**: Success will yield a lead formulation and comprehensive preclinical dataset supporting Phase II IND-enabling studies. Beyond ASUC, this modular platform can encapsulate other hydrophobic immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, sirolimus) and extends to maintenance IBD therapy—a $2B+ market currently inaccessible due to CsA toxicity. Our approach establishes plant EVs as a viable alternative to synthetic nanocarriers, with advantages in cost (~$0.10/dose from juice waste), scalability, and regulatory path (food-grade ingredients).

**Commercialization Strategy**: Phase I delivers formulation SOPs, efficacy/safety data, and patent protection. Phase II (Years 2-3) will complete GLP toxicology and CMC for IND filing, targeting Phase IIa clinical trial in ASUC patients by Year 4. We have identified three potential pharma partners interested in oral CsA reformulations for IBD and transplant indications.
