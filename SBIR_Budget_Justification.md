## BUDGET JUSTIFICATION BY QUARTER

| Quarter | Focus | Major Expenses | Amount |
|---------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Q1** | Formulation development | EV isolation, CsA loading, qEV columns, HPLC | $125,000 |

| **Q4** | Data analysis, reporting | Consultant time, publication, Phase II writing | $50,000 |

---

## COST EFFICIENCY MEASURES

### What We're NOT Buying (but have access to):

✅ **Ultracentrifuge**: Available through institutional core ($50/run)
✅ **NTA/DLS instruments**: Core facility access ($100/sample)
✅ **Flow cytometer**: Core facility ($100/hour)
✅ **HPLC**: In-house instrument (only buying consumables)
✅ **Cell culture incubators**: Existing lab equipment
✅ **Fluorescence microscope**: Institutional access

**Estimated savings**: $250K+ in equipment costs

---

### Cost-Saving Alternatives Considered:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **UC vs SEC for EV isolation** | Using SEC (qEV) despite higher per-unit cost because it's faster, more reproducible, and preserves EV integrity → reduces downstream failures |
| **Commercial PBMCs vs fresh isolation** | Commercial ensures consistency across experiments; fresh isolation saves $2K but introduces donor variability |
| **Outsourced LC-MS vs in-house** | CsA quantification requires validated method; outsourcing is more cost-effective than method development + QC |
| **Blinded pathologist scoring** | Essential for unbiased efficacy assessment; cannot compromise on this endpoint |

---

   - Analytical method validation

2. **GLP Toxicology** ($500K)
   - 28-day repeat-dose study in rats (outsourced CRO)
   - Genotoxicity panel
   - Safety pharmacology (renal function focus)

3. **Large Animal PK/Efficacy** ($300K)
   - Canine colitis model (closer to human anatomy)
   - PK in non-rodent species (regulatory requirement)

4. **IND-Enabling CMC** ($200K)
   - Stability program (3, 6, 12 months)
   - Container-closure qualification
