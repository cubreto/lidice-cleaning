- Target: ≥3-fold increase in CsA release with PLA2 vs. control
**Timeline:** 1 week

#### Task 5: In Vitro T-Cell Suppression (Optional, if time permits)
**Responsibility:** Dr. Herrera's lab or collaborator
**Protocol:** Invention Disclosure, Example 5
**Key experiment:**
- Activate human PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28
- Test: Free CsA, Free prodrug, PDEV-prodrug (with/without PLA2)
- Measure IL-2 by ELISA
- Target: PDEV-prodrug + PLA2 achieves ≥50% suppression at half dose vs. free CsA
**Timeline:** 2 weeks

### Summary of Preliminary Data Timeline
- **Weeks 1-2:** Procure prodrugs (if contract synthesis, 8-12 weeks delivery)
- **Week 2:** Isolate citrus EVs
- **Weeks 3-4:** Integrate prodrugs into EVs, quantify incorporation
- **Week 4:** PLA2-triggered release assay
- **(Optional) Weeks 5-6:** In vitro T-cell suppression

**Realistic timeline for SBIR submission:** 10-12 weeks (if using contract synthesis) OR 6-8 weeks (if prodrugs already available)

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR DR. HERRERA

**Subject:** Revised Invention Disclosure & SBIR Grant Strategy - Ready for Review

Dear Dr. Herrera,

I've completed a comprehensive revision of the invention disclosure and SBIR specific aims based on technical corrections. The key change:

**Original approach (FLAWED):** CsA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles nested inside plant EVs (technically incompatible)

**Revised approach (CORRECT):** CsA-phospholipid prodrugs integrated directly into plant EV membranes

This approach:
1. Builds on validated prodrug chemistry from published literature (reduces technical risk)
2. Provides clear novelty through carrier integration (plant EVs)
3. Maintains dual-level control (EV targeting + PLA2 activation)
4. Strengthens patent position (composition + method claims)

**Attached documents:**
- `SBIR_Specific_Aims_PDEV_Prodrug.pdf` (4 pages) - Camera-ready for grant submission
- `Invention_Disclosure_PDEV_Prodrug.pdf` (26 pages) - Complete disclosure for patent attorney
- `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed explanation of all changes

**Next steps I recommend:**
1. **Review documents** - Confirm you agree with the revised technical approach
2. **Patent attorney consultation** - Schedule meeting within 48 hours
3. **Provisional patent filing** - File within 7 days to establish priority
4. **Preliminary data** - Discuss timeline for procuring CsA-prodrugs and isolating citrus EVs

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a call to discuss.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
